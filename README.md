ShowAutoRenamer
===============

Automagically renames all your episodes to nicer, easier to read format. For example by default the name for Walking Dead Season 1 Episode 1 will be:
S01E01 - Days Gone Bye. 

Alpha builds are for testing, they will be always at least partly working but they are not tested.
Beta build should be at least somehow tested, most of new things for the release are done and this is bugfixing phase mostly
Stable builds should be the most stable builds, but I don't gurantee anything

##Features

- Beautiful and user friendly
- Smart-Rename (Automatically and asynchronously finds episode name) (Currently supports English, Czech(coming soon))
